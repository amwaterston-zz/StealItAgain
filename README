Smash It!
=========

Originally this was called StealItAgain for obvious reasons - turns out smashing is even more fun that stealing.

This src does not include the required data - a picture of a lego man and a bunch of images for the glass objects at NMS.

You will need a number of Move Controllers to play - it enters an infinite loop if you have less than 2 connected so don't do that.

We will tidy things up over the next week or so and maybe run a big old playtest of it once it's actually fun. We have some ideas about how to make it fun because, at the moment, to be honest, it isn't really.
